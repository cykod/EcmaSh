== README

1. Source command errors
2. History up / down
3. Editor below
4. Create file
6. Rip out paperclip
7. Run command (esh files) (split by line)

Editor:
=======

normal mode - save and quit
track dirty?
theme
syntax highlighting
should be able to create a new file.


ToDo:
=====

esh files that run a bunch of commands [ store commands in a list of lists - pick of one command, pipe and then do the next.

add source command
set ENV variables

parsing options (-r)
multiple argumentsf
3. Figure out hosting / directory structure - .domain file
5. up / down for history
8. public / private directories
9. Add bing search api + JSON awk-type extractor
10. Deploy to digital ocean

ecmash

Create Jasmine tests for the models


JAWK 

{ result: [ { a: "b" }, { a: "c" } ] } -> ["b", "c" ]

cmd | pluck $$.result | map [ $$.a ] -> [ [ "b" ], [ "c" ]]



[ [ 0, 1, { a: 7 } ], [ 2, 4, { a: 8 } ] ] 

-> 1,4

cmd | map $$[2].a >> test.json





pipe pipes the actual JSON around - use JS to extract

JSH - js shell files that can be get or posted to on the domain

Hosting
=========
.txt, .css, .html and .js, .json and .csv served directly
everything else served via cloudfront

// Access to a DB
POST /db/username/somthing
GET /db/username/something



CLI - Backbone models, some client only based cones (clear), some server based (mv, ls)
These translate to commands that just hit /commands/ with a session-based API key

cp
edit - codemirror with regular binding
vi - codemirror with vi keybindings
style
run
public - make a directory public
private - make a directory private (not listable, but files are viewable online, default)
secret - make a directory only accessible via an API key
vsplit - split into two console, left and right
hsplit - split into two consoles, top and bottom
close - close this console

echo - same as echo
clear - clear screen
refresh / clear env - clear the environment
quit - quit the shell
zoom - zoom in
unzoom - zoom out
apikey - return my api key (apikey create|expire)

eventually, git, ftp, apis, etc
